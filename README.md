# Bandcamp Stock Count

A browser extension that shows the number of items in stock on [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) album pages.

## Installation

### Edge

The extension is [available on Microsoft Edge Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/bandcamp-stock-count/odapaghohealagmnapgcpnmflmcilhgc).

### Mozilla Firefox

You can install the extension from the [Mozilla Add-Ons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/bandcamp-stock-count/).

### Google Chrome

Unfortunately, to upload extensions to the Google Chrome Extensions store, Google requires signing up as a Google developer which costs a fee.
For now, the only way to install the extension is to download it locally and install it in developer mode.

1. Download this repo as a zip file and unpack it to a location where you want to keep it.
2. Rename manifest_chrome.json to just manifest.json and delete manifest_firefox.json
3. In Chrome, go to _Chrome menu/More tools/Extensions_.
4. Enable developer mode in the top right corner.
5. Click on "load unpacked" and navigate to the folder of the unpacked extension, or drag and drop the unpacked folder on the Extensions page.
